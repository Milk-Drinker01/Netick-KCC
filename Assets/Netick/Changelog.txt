### [1.1.0] Changelog - 2023/3/9

- Added a new feature called Spawn-Prediction that lets you spawn-predict network objects on the client without having to wait for the server to create the object. Check out the docs to learn how to use it.
- Added SpawnTick property to NetworkObject. It's the tick at which the object was spawned/instantiated.
- Added ResimulationStep to NetworkSandbox. It's the current resimulation step.
- Added PlayerId property to NetworkPlayer. PlayerId is the networked index of a NetworkPlayer. It can be used as an Id of Input Sources to be used for things like a spawn prediction key.
- Changed the way scene network objects are initialized on the server. Now, when NetworkStart is called for scene objects on the server, all scene network objects will be initialized and have valid Ids. Previously if you happened to access the Id of one of the other scene objects, it might have yet to be initialized and therefore would have -1 Id. 
- Fixed a bug where spawning and despawning network prefab instances rapidly and at high ping might cause a bad packet exception on the client because the server confuses between the recycled prefab instances and assume the client has spawned an object it hasn't.
- Fixed a bug where if you call an Rpc on a network object and then destroy it, it will result in a bad packet exception on the client.
- Fixed a bug where mispredictions might happen if Max Packets Per Update was less than the needed packets count to send all changed data.
- Fixed a bug where network prefab pools are not reset correctly when switching scenes.

### [1.0.6] Changelog - 2023/2/18

- Fixed an issue where you will receive empty inputs from FetchInput when multiple fixed updates are executed within one Unity update cycle.
- Fixed an interpolation bug when spawning a pooled network object - where the object will interpolate between the last position before it was destroyed and the new position it was spawned at.
- Fixed an issue where updating Netick results in duplicate empty folders named Netick 1, Netick 2, Netick 3, etc.
- Fixed an issue with Network.Init
- Fixed an issue where sometimes Sandbox.Physics/Sandbox.Physics2D wouldn't be updated when switching scenes.
- Fixed various other bugs.

### [0.9.10] Changelog - 2022/12/1
